Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color, because its the red planet
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.

Brandon, I was showing Timbre how cool it would be if she could go to mars with us. We should get her hooked up 
on this.. I wonder what Count Drakular and Wolfman would think? What do you think?

I think this is a great idea. She should bring a friend for me and the wolfman lol

I will run this by her next time I see her. This is Great News!

I haven't asked her yet, but I still think she would be interested given that her major is Masters in 
information systems.
